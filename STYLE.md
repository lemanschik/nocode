# No Code Style Guide

All no code programs are the same, regardless of use case, any code you write is a liability.

## File Extensions

No code is not stored in files

```

```

## Linters

There is only one way to write no code and the `mv * /dev/null` command can help you and auto fix any issues. 

```

```

```

```

> The only valid code is no code.

## Code Reviews

The no code community has adopted the following conventions when reviewing code changes:

```
LGTM +1
```

When the change includes code additions or modifications: Code Is A Liability

```
CIAL -1 
```

> Change requests that fall into this category should be rejected immediately.
